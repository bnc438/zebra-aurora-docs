# Managing Execution Time

The JavaScript execution time may be unstable at times. Avoid instability by understanding its sources, just-in-time compiler operation, and garbage collector usage.

While smaller scripts typically do not result in instability, observed irregularities in script execution times result from two primary sources:

- **Just-in-time compiler operation.** When developing a script, subsequent iterations after the initial script are accelerated.
- **The JavaScript memory model uses a garbage collector.** Scripts that use a lot of memory must periodically use the garbage collector to clean up unused memory during execution, reducing the time it takes to execute.
