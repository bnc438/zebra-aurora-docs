# Script Invocation

The script executes at the end of each job when results are available. Its execution time includes the job's execution time.

The `onResults` function executes new arguments at the end of each job iteration. If there are any errors in the script, a standard JavaScript exception is thrown and propagated to Aurora Focus with no outputs set.

:::note

:::

During the first iteration, the script execution may take longer because script code not enclosed in functions is executed first, such as initializing global variables.

:::note

All other forms of result formatting are disabled when JavaScript is enabled.
