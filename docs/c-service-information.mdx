# Service Information

If you have a problem with your equipment, contact Zebra Global Customer Support for your region. Contact information is available at: [zebra.com/support](https://www.zebra.com/support).

When contacting support, please have the following information available:

- Serial number of the unit
- Model number or product name
- Software/firmware type and version number

Zebra responds to calls by email, telephone, or fax within the time limits set forth in support agreements.

If your problem cannot be solved by Zebra Customer Support, you may need to return your equipment for servicing and will be given specific directions. Zebra is not responsible for any damages incurred during shipment if the approved shipping container is not used. Shipping the units improperly can possibly void the warranty.

If you purchased your Zebra business product from a Zebra business partner, contact that business partner for support.
