# HID Keyboard

Enable the HID keyboard to use the device in HID keyboard mode. Assign a string, a single button, a key, and a modifier combination. You can also add a pause between keystrokes. All of these can be leveraged into a single assignment.

```typescript
hid?: (string|(IHIDCombinationResult| IHIDPauseResult|HIDKey|string)[]);

An additional helper object, HID, is available to simplify HID usage. HID properties are described in the following table.

Helper Object HID Properties
Property	Description
HID.key	Gives access to a list of available keys.
HID.combination	Allows the creation of a key and a modifier combination.
HID.pause	Allows a pause between consecutive keystrokes to be created.
HID.modifier	Gives access to a list of available key modifiers.
:::note

HID.pause argument must be between 0 and 25000 ms.

HID.combination allows you to press, at the same time, a key and up to 8 different modifiers.

HID.combination produces a series of consecutive keystrokes with the same modifiers when used with more than one key.

Keystroke delay and preferred keyboard layout can be changed through the Communication tab in the device settings.

If that property is not assigned, nothing is printed.
