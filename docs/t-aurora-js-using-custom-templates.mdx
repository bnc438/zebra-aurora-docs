# Using Custom Templates

Integrate your own JavaScript templates into Aurora Focus.

Create your template in a file with a `.js` extension, locate the Aurora Focus folder (where the application is installed), and save it in the `resources\\public\\js_editor_templates` subfolder.

After restarting the application, the template is available in the **Use template** section under **Edit** in the top navigation bar.

:::note

The custom template you create is only available in that instance of Aurora Focus. If the file is deleted, the template is no longer available.
