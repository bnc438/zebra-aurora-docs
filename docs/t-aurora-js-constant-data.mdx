# Constant Data

Each script has a global variable called `DEVICE` that is available from anywhere in the code. They contain constant data about the current device. When using an emulator, this variable contains applicable messages about a lack of support.

`DEVICE` is described by the following type:

```typescript
interface IDevice {
 hostname: string;
 model: string;
 part_number: string;
 serial_number: string;
 uuid: string;
 firmware_version: string;
 type: DeviceType;
 sensor: ISensor;
 gpio: IGPIO;
}

Using the following types:

enum DeviceType {
  REAL = "REAL",
  EMULATED = "EMULATED",
}

enum GpioPortState {
  DISABLE = "DISABLE",
  TRIGGER = "TRIGGER",
  JOB_SWITCH = "JOB_SWITCH",
  ILLUMINATION_STROBE = "ILLUMINATION_STROBE",
  INPUT = "INPUT",
  OUTPUT_PUSH_PULL = "OUTPUT_PUSH_PULL",
  OUTPUT_HIGH_SIDE = "OUTPUT_HIGH_SIDE",
  OUTPUT_STATIC_HIGH = "OUTPUT_STATIC_HIGH",
  OUTPUT_STATIC_LOW = "OUTPUT_STATIC_LOW",
  OUTPUT = "OUTPUT",
}

interface IGPIOPort {
  number: number;
  state: IGpioPortState;
}

interface IGPIO {
  count: number;
  ports: IGPIOPort[];
}

interface ISensor {
  sensor_type: string;
  width: number;
  height: number;
}
