# Sample Scripts

The following sample scripts demonstrate different scenarios and editor features.

Click **Edit** on the top menu bar in the **Use template** section to use additional sample scripts. Each template has comments that describe the general purpose and blocks of code.

```javascript
/**
* Read all codes using ManyCode, order them alphabetically, separate them with a comma, and output them over TCP.
* Ensure that the Barcode Tool is in the first position in this job—otherwise, the code might return errors and not work.  
* Please do not remove the 'export' keyword or this comment.
* onResults function triggers on the results of each job run.
* For more detailed information, please refer to the documentation.
* @param {IMainArguments} input_result - object with results of the job.
* @returns {IMainResult} - object defining outputs per interface.
