# Limitations

Understand the current limitations of the script editor and strategize so you do not encounter any issues.

- The ability to use external modules using the `import` keyword and the required functions is disabled.
- Asynchronous functions are not supported. Helper functions necessary to implement asynchronous functions, such as `setTimeout`, are not present.
- Network or file system IO functions are not supported.
- If memory usage exceeds a specific limit, the scripting environment restarts (including restarting global variables). This is no different from other runtime errors, except for refreshing the state and the time it takes to restart the environment. This can occur if you create a global variable in an array and add elements in every iteration, but do not remove them.
